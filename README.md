AI detectors hand you a verdict-shaped guess. noslop hands you the exact words to change:
every buzzword, filler phrase, contrast-frame cliché, stray em dash, and flat-rhythm
paragraph, underlined where it sits, with a line number and a reason. Deterministic, so
the same text gets the same score every time. Local, so your unpublished draft never
touches anyone's server.

> **The proof is the product: this README scores 0.0/1k on noslop itself, and CI fails the build the day that stops being true.**

Four ways to run it: paste into the [browser app](https://munzzyy.github.io/noslop/), drop the CLI into a pre-commit hook or CI, wire it into [reviewdog](#hooks) for inline PR comments, or install it as a skill so your AI coding agent checks its own prose before handing it back to you.

**[Try it in your browser](https://munzzyy.github.io/noslop/).** Paste a draft and watch the tells light up. It all runs client-side, so nothing you paste is uploaded, stored, or sent anywhere.

Prefer the terminal? It's also one Python file with no dependencies that drops into a pre-commit hook or CI. Same scoring engine either way, and either way it runs locally and deterministically with no network access.

## Why this and not a detector

| | noslop | AI detectors (SaaS) | Vale + ai-tells |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tells you *what to fix*, word by word | yes — line numbers and hints | no — one probability score | vocabulary and phrasing |
| Sentence-rhythm and formatting tells | yes | opaque | no ([their own docs name the gap](#vs-vale--vale-ai-tells)) |
| Languages | sixteen, each researched separately | English-first | English |
| Your draft stays on your machine | always — even the browser app | uploaded to their servers | yes |
| Same text, same score, every time | yes — CLI and browser parity-tested | no, model-dependent | yes |
| Pre-commit, CI, agent skill | all three, zero dependencies | paid API, upload required | pre-commit, via a Vale install |
| Open source, auditable scoring | every weight in one file | no | yes |

Nothing else combines that column. And the honest limits are documented [below](#limitations) — a
clean score means these tells are absent, not that a human typed it. That's the linter's contract:
catch what's catchable, show the work, leave the verdict-guessing to tools that enjoy being wrong.

## As an agent skill

Point your coding agent at noslop and it'll lint its own writing before handing a PR description, commit message, or doc back to you. Two install paths, pick whichever your agent supports:

```bash
# Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add munzzyy/noslop
/plugin install noslop@noslop

# any agent using the open Agent Skills standard (Codex, Cursor, and others)
npx skills add munzzyy/noslop
```

Either way, the agent gets [SKILL.md](skills/noslop/SKILL.md): what to run, how to read the score, and the rule that it flags but never rewrites - the rewrite stays the agent's job, same as it's always been yours. Ask the agent something like "check this PR description for AI tells before you post it" and it'll run `noslop.py --json` on the draft and act on what comes back.

## In your browser

[munzzyy.github.io/noslop](https://munzzyy.github.io/noslop/) is the whole tool as a single page. Paste or type, and every buzzword, filler phrase, construction, stray em dash, and emoji gets underlined in place, with a live score and a breakdown of exactly what tripped it. No build step, no account, no server: the page loads the same scorer the CLI uses and runs it on your machine. You can save the page and use it offline.

Nine themes from the header - Paper and Ink, plus Terminal, Sepia, Newsprint, Midnight, both Solarized variants, and a high-contrast mode. Auto follows your system by default; your pick is remembered and applied before the page paints.

> Looking for a package literally named `noslop` on PyPI or npm? Those are different projects - an LLM-based rewriter and an old code-quality tool. This one's git-only for now; see [Install](#install).

## Example

```
$ noslop pr.txt
words: 41   AI-tell score: 658.5/1k   -> reads as AI - needs a real rewrite

LLM buzzwords:
   1x  delves             (lines 1)
   1x  seamlessly         (lines 1)
   1x  streamline         (lines 1)
   1x  robust             (lines 2)
   1x  comprehensive      (lines 3)

Filler phrases:
   1x  "it's important to note" (lines 2)
   1x  "not just a" (lines 2)
   1x  "i hope this helps" (lines 3)

Constructions:
   1x  'not just X but Y' construction (lines 2)
        -> state it plainly instead of the contrast frame
$ echo $?
1
```

## Sixteen languages

An LLM writing Spanish slop doesn't use translations of the English tells - it has its
own crutches (*sumérgete*, *sin fisuras*, *cabe destacar*), and German slop leans on
*nahtlos* and *es ist wichtig zu beachten*. So every language here carries its own
researched lists, not a machine translation of the English ones: English, Spanish,
French, German, Portuguese (Brazil), Italian, Dutch, Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech,
Turkish, Swedish, Romanian, Hungarian, and Finnish.

The input language is sniffed per file from stop-word coverage (standard library only,
nothing phones home) and every pack keeps the same weights, so a 25+/1k verdict means
the same thing in every language. Punctuation habits that differ by language are tuned
per pack - Spanish dialogue dashes don't get flagged as em-dash spray. Force a language
with `--lang` when you know better:

```bash
noslop --lang de entwurf.md
noslop informe.md            # auto-detected per file
```

Text the sniffer can't confidently place falls back to the English lists plus the
structural checks (rhythm, formatting, emoji), and the output says so instead of
pretending - `--json` carries `language` and `language_source`
(`detected` / `forced` / `fallback`).

Some languages are deliberately absent rather than badly present. Danish and Norwegian
Bokmål share too many function words to tell apart by this method, Greek's candidate
list ran into words that are ordinary prose there, and a few others would have been
guesses. Chinese, Japanese, and Korean need different tokenization entirely, so they
aren't faked with the current pipeline. A pack only ships when the tells are real.

The browser app follows along: its interface reads in 32 languages (pick from the globe
menu), it shows which language it detected in your text, and you can override that per
paste.

## Install

From PyPI (the command it installs is `noslop`):

```bash
pip install noslop-lint
```

Or with pipx, straight from the repo:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/munzzyy/noslop
```

Or skip the install entirely, since it's a single file with no dependencies:

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/munzzyy/noslop/main/noslop.py
python noslop.py --help
```

## Usage

```bash
noslop draft.md                     # one file
noslop docs/*.md                    # several files
git log -1 --format=%B | noslop     # or stdin
noslop --quiet draft.md             # verdict line only
noslop --json draft.md              # results as JSON
noslop --exclude CHANGELOG.md docs/*.md   # skip a file in a glob run
noslop --lang es informe.md         # force a language pack (default: auto-detect)
```

The exit code is 0 when every input scores under the threshold, 1 when something scores over it, and 2 if a path couldn't be read at all - so a crash and a lint finding never look the same to a script. The default threshold is 10; change it with `--threshold`. `docs/*.md` works even on Windows shells that don't expand the glob themselves.

In markdown files, fenced code blocks and inline code are not scored, since code samples aren't prose. Pass `--markdown` to get the same treatment for stdin or other file extensions.

To skip files in a glob or directory run without listing them all on the command line, drop a `.noslopignore` next to them (one glob per line, `#` comments allowed) or repeat `--exclude PATTERN`.

## Config

Editing `noslop.py` directly to change the word lists works, but it doesn't survive a `pipx` upgrade. For anything that needs to persist, drop a `.noslop.json` in your repo root (noslop walks up from the current directory looking for one, stopping at the first `.git` it finds):

```json
{
  "ignore_words": ["robust", "leverage"],
  "ignore_phrases": ["at the end of the day"],
  "extra_words": ["synergize"],
  "extra_phrases": ["circle back"]
}
```

`ignore_words` / `ignore_phrases` remove entries from the built-in lists, `extra_words` / `extra_phrases` add your own on top. All four keys are optional. Use `--config PATH` to point at a specific file instead of relying on the directory walk, or `--no-config` to ignore any config file for one run.

## Hooks

As a plain git hook:

```bash
# .git/hooks/commit-msg
noslop --quiet "$1" || echo "that commit message reads a bit AI"
```

Written like that it only warns. Drop the `|| echo` part if you want it to actually reject the commit.

With [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com):

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/munzzyy/noslop
    rev: v0.6.0
    hooks:
      - id: noslop
```

That runs on the markdown, text, and rst files in each commit.

As a GitHub Action, no pre-commit framework required:

```yaml
- uses: munzzyy/noslop@v0.6.0
  with:
    paths: "docs/*.md README.md"
```

For inline PR review comments instead of a plain CI log, pipe `--rdjson` output into [reviewdog](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog):

```bash
python noslop.py --rdjson docs/*.md | reviewdog -f=rdjsonl -name=noslop -reporter=github-pr-review
```

`--rdjson` prints one JSON object per finding (message, file, line, severity) instead of the normal report, and pairs with `--exclude`/`.noslopignore` the same way `--json` does.

## What it checks

The word and phrase lists live at the top of [noslop.py](noslop.py); edit them directly if you're hacking on noslop itself, or use a [config file](#config) if you just want to adjust the lists for your own project. Roughly:

- **chat-UI residue** - leftover citation markup (`oaicite`, `oai_citation`, `grok_card`)
  and `utm_source=chatgpt.com` links. Nobody types these by hand, so one hit scores the
  hard verdict on its own. (Writing *about* these markers trips it too - quote them in
  code formatting, or skip the file with `.noslopignore`.)
- words LLMs lean on far more than people do (`delve`, `robust`, `leverage`, `tapestry` -
  plus the words two 2025 word-frequency studies measured at 3x-67x their pre-LLM baseline:
  `groundbreaking`, `surpassing`, `garnered`, `emphasizing`, and friends)
- boilerplate phrases (`it's important to note`, `let's dive into`, `I hope this helps`) and
  significance inflation (`stands as a testament`, `continues to captivate`, `a pivotal moment`)
- the `not just X, but Y` contrast frame, the `it isn't X, it's Y` flip, and its split-sentence
  cousin: `The problem isn't X. It's Y.`
- the dangling `-ing` significance closer (`..., highlighting the importance of...`)
- rhetorical-question openers, mid-sentence question hooks (`The result? ...`), and
  ta-da openers (`Here's why...`)
- sycophantic chat openers (`Great question!`) that leaked into prose
- anaphora triads (`where X, where Y, where Z`) - the second one on, a single triad is
  just rhetoric
- sentence-initial connective spray (`Moreover... Furthermore... Additionally...`),
  scored on density, never on one hit
- em dashes well past normal density, emoji in prose, and emoji decorating headings
- runs of `**Term:** explanation` bullets (with or without the bullet), bold-emphasis
  spray inside running prose
- curly and straight quotes mixed in one document - usually a paste boundary
- staccato runs of three-plus tiny sentences, sentence lengths with almost no variation,
  paragraph lengths with almost no variation
- all of the above that's language-independent runs for every language; the vocabulary,
  phrase, and construction lists are researched per language, never machine-translated

Each hit has a weight, the weights are summed, and the total is scaled per 1,000 words. Under 10 usually reads fine. From 10 to 25 the text deserves a second pass, and past 25 it needs rewriting rather than word swaps. The cutoffs are judgment calls, not measurements; if they fight your material, move `--threshold`.

The `--json` field names (`words`, `score_per_1k`, `verdict`, `language`, `language_source`, `buzzwords`, `phrases`, `patterns`, and the rest) are treated as a stable interface once something depends on them - a pinned test in the suite locks the key set, so a rename shows up as a broken test rather than a silent break in whatever's parsing the output.

## vs. Vale / vale-ai-tells

If you're already running [Vale](https://vale.sh), [vale-ai-tells](https://github.com/tbhb/vale-ai-tells) covers a lot of the same ground with Vale's own style-rule format. The gap it names in its own docs is sentence-length uniformity and paragraph rhythm - it checks vocabulary and phrasing, not cadence. noslop's `sentence_uniformity_cv` check is exactly that: a coefficient-of-variation measure that catches the suspiciously even sentence lengths LLMs tend to produce even when the vocabulary itself passes. And noslop doesn't need a Vale install or a `.vale.ini` to get there - it's one file, stdlib only.

## Measured, not vibes

`eval/` holds a labeled corpus - 16 samples of unedited LLM output across genres, 16 samples
of human writing from essays to old cookbooks to a 2016 Rails README - and a scorer that
reports detection rate, false-positive rate, and AUC against it. The current engine catches
**14 of 16 AI samples** at the "worth a pass" threshold (up from 6 of 16 on the previous
engine) and flags **one human sample** (Thoreau, who writes about literal landscapes with
heavy em dashes - the receipts are in [eval/README.md](eval/README.md)). CI runs the eval
with floors, so a change that trades false positives for recall fails the build instead of
shipping quietly.

## Limitations

- It matches surface patterns, not intent. A document that quotes slop in running prose gets flagged for it, quotation marks or not. Code formatting is the only escape hatch it understands.
- The lists are one person's research-informed opinion, sixteen languages deep. If `robust` is a term of art in your field, edit the list or raise the threshold.
- The sentence-uniformity check shares a mechanism with the burstiness signal that a Stanford study ([Liang et al. 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389923001307)) showed flags non-native English writers far more than native ones. That's why it adds a small fixed bump instead of a verdict, why its weight didn't go up in 0.7.0, and why no rhythm check alone can push clean text past the hard threshold. If you write in a second language and noslop nags you about rhythm, that's the check to ignore.
- A clean score doesn't mean the writing is good, and it doesn't prove a human wrote it. It means none of these particular tells showed up. A careful writer can trip it, and lazy slop can slip past it.
