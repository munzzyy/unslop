"""noslop - flag the AI tells in a piece of writing.

Reads text from file arguments or stdin and prints the patterns that make prose
read as LLM-generated: filler phrases, overused buzzwords, the "not just X, but Y"
frame, em-dash spray, emoji, suspiciously even sentence and paragraph rhythm,
staccato fragment runs, bold-emphasis spray, mixed quote styles, and - the
smoking gun - literal chat-UI residue like leftover citation markup or
"utm_source=chatgpt.com" links. It does NOT rewrite anything - that's your
job. It just shows you where to look.

Speaks more than English: each language in LANGUAGES carries its own researched
tell lists (an LLM's crutch words in Spanish are Spanish, not translations of
the English list). Input language is sniffed per file, or forced with --lang;
text that can't be confidently identified falls back to the English pack plus
the structural checks, and the output says so.

Standard library only. No network, no dependencies.

Usage:
  noslop draft.md
  noslop docs/*.md
  echo "some text here" | noslop
  noslop --json draft.md       # machine-readable
  noslop --quiet draft.md      # verdict line only

Exit code is 0 when every input reads human enough, 1 when something needs
a pass, and 2 if a path couldn't be read at all - so a crash and a lint
finding never look the same to a script.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Language packs.
#
# An LLM over-writing in Spanish doesn't overuse translations of the English
# buzzword list - it has its own crutches (sumérgete, sin fisuras, cabe
# destacar). So every language here carries its own researched lists, written
# from how LLM prose actually reads in that language, never machine-translated
# from English. If you add a pack, add the same pack to web/detector.js and a
# fixture pair to web/parity.js, or CI goes red.
#
# Pack fields:
#   name          native display name
#   buzzwords     per-language BUZZWORDS equivalent
#   phrases       per-language PHRASES equivalent
#   patterns      per-language PATTERNS equivalent (labels/hints localized)
#   stopwords     high-frequency function words, used only by detect_language()
#   marks         characters distinctive of the language, a detection tiebreak
#   em_dash_factor  multiplier on the em-dash allowance. Spanish, French,
#                 Italian, and Portuguese use long dashes for dialogue, so an
#                 allowance tuned for English prose would flag ordinary
#                 dialogue punctuation. 1.0 keeps the English behavior.
#                 Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Turkish, and Romanian join that
#                 dialogue-dash tier (2.5) for the same reason - each opens a
#                 line of dialogue with the dash by literary convention, and
#                 Russian/Ukrainian also use it as a zero-copula substitute
#                 ("Это - хорошо"). Hungarian's gondolatjel sees real but
#                 less totalizing dialogue use, so it gets German's partial
#                 1.5 rather than the full allowance. Czech, Swedish, and
#                 Finnish dialogue is conventionally quotation-mark-based, so
#                 they keep the English 1.0.
#
# The weights (3 per buzzword/phrase hit, pattern weights, +8 uniformity) are
# the same in every pack, so a 25+/1k verdict means the same thing in every
# language. The structural checks that don't depend on wording - chat-UI
# artifacts, staccato runs, paragraph uniformity, heading emoji, bold spray,
# quote mixing, opener concentration - run identically for every language,
# so packs only need to localize vocabulary, phrases, and patterns.

# string never reads as a comment and a "#" in a C preprocessor line never
# does either. Each rule then looks only where its evidence lives: prose

# code itself.

# Comment/string syntax families. "line" markers run to end of line, "block"
# pairs nest only where the language actually nests them (Rust), "triple"
# turns on Python-style triple-quoted strings and docstring detection,
# "backtick" turns on JS template literals, "quotes" lists the characters
# that open a string. Lisp keeps only double quotes: a leading apostrophe
